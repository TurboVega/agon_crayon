Test files for showing more colors on the AgonLight

Please note that this represents the state of these files at the time they were published,
and not all current fixes and additions have been pushed up to this repository, because
they are being developed in conjunction (i.e., hooked into) vdp-gl (the agon-vdp, which is
a fork of the original FabGL used for AgonLight).

Therefore, look at these files with caution, because they are not the most recent ones!
