// di_tile_map.h - Function declarations for drawing tile maps
//
// A tile map is a set of rectangular tiles, where each tile is a bitmap of
// the same size (width and height). Tiles are arranged in a rectangular
// grid, where the entire portion of the grid that fits within the visible
// area of the screen may be displayed at any given moment. In other words
// multiple tiles show at the same time.
